    <p><strong>Who We Are.</strong></p>
    <p><strong></strong>&nbsp;Team 2702 Eastwood Rebels is a&nbsp;FIRST&nbsp;Robotics team founded in 2008 as an extra-curricular program for students in grades nine to twelve. In our first year of competition the Rebels received the Rookie All-Star Award sending us to our first championship. Since then, The Rebels has become a force to reckon with winning the 2011 Wisconsin Regional and traveling to the World Championships to compete soon after.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;In addition to our growing reputation at competitions, 2702 Rebels does not hesitate to get involved with the community through numerous outreach&nbsp;functions.
Our mission is to inspire a unique array of knowledge, creativity and pride from our experience on a highly respected team.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;Our program inspires students to pursue careers in the fields of engineering, science, technology, math, and business.2702 Rebels not only creates future abilities but also instills important life values such as teamwork, goal setting, and confidence just to name a few. This is not accomplished though without the dedicated mentors and countless hours&nbsp;the team&nbsp;spends together throughout the robotics season.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;Our mentors work alongside the students ensuring success in a healthy learning environment especially throughout the crunch of the six week build season. As important members of the The Rebels team, mentors guide students through technical, electrical, programming, design, and business struggles.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;Everyday The Rebels strives to live up to&nbsp;FIRST’s core values of reaching out to other teams. We have done this by mentoring three FRC rookie teams in 2011, 2012, and 2013 and have also recently reached out to our younger counterparts by hosting and volunteering at a Waterloo Regional FLL Tournament.
Improvement is always on the the Rebels to-do list.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This is evident through our dedication to the robot not only in the build season but also prior to and after. For example, the team meetings start early in October educating students on how to improve design, programming, and overall organization to make the upcoming season as successful as possible.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;We strive to make our robot a leading example by embracing leading high-tech components and sensor technology as shown through our numerous Innovation and Control&nbsp;Awards&nbsp;sponsored by Rockwell Automation.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;None of what makes this team great would be attainable without the help of our sponsors, dedicated mentors, inspiring teachers, and supportive parents. Thanks to everyone who makes our team possible!
